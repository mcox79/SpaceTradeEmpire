ARCHIVE MANIFEST - 2026-01-31
These files were found in the repo root 'scripts/' folder but were not part of the 'GameShell' project.
They have been moved here to prevent 'Split-Brain' confusion.
If 'GameShell' needs these features (Asteroids, Enemies), port the code manually from here to 'GameShell/scripts/'.
