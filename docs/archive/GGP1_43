# Segmentation Mode v4.3.2: Epic segmentation with full attach proofs (no patches)

You are in Segmentation Mode only.

## Goal
Using ONLY the attached files, produce a reviewable segmentation for EPIC_A with:
- exactly 5 candidate items for EPIC_A,
- one-session feasibility estimate per item,
- attachment sketches VERIFIED to exist via the context packet file map,
- compact proof sections quoting file-map lines for ALL emitted paths,
- strict axis coverage so the epic is not reduced to one subsystem,
- reduced reliance on scripts paths unless explicitly permitted.

Do NOT output any JSON patches.
Do NOT propose edits to any repo files.

## Attachments (only these)
1) docs/generated/01_CONTEXT_PACKET.md (required: HEAD hash, repo file map)
2) docs/54_EPICS.md
3) docs/gates/gates.json
4) docs/gates/gates.schema.json
5) docs/gates/GATE_FREEZE_RULES.md

Do not request or use any other files.

## Session modes (mandatory)
- OUTPUT_MODE = ANALYSIS_ONLY
- GIT_MODE = NO_STAGE

## Non-negotiable rules (hard)

### 1) File-map truth
- You may ONLY reference repo paths that appear in the file map inside docs/generated/01_CONTEXT_PACKET.md.
- If a candidate path is not found, you MUST replace it with a found path.
- Your final output must contain ZERO non-existent paths.

### 2) No invented coverage claims
- Do not claim anything is DONE unless it is a gate present in docs/gates/gates.json.
- Existing coverage for EPIC_A may be “unclear”; that is allowed.

### 3) Output boundedness
- EPIC_A: exactly 5 candidate items (no more, no less).
- EPIC_B: omitted in this mode.
- No essays. Only the required sections.

### 4) Formatting hard rules
- Output must be pure Markdown. HTML tags (including <br>) are forbidden.
- Attachment sketch must be ONE line: paths separated by ; (semicolon+space).

## Deterministic EPIC_A selection (hard)
- Scan docs/54_EPICS.md in order.
- Choose EPIC_A as the FIRST epic whose epic key token begins with EPIC.X..
- If no epic key begins with EPIC.X., choose the FIRST epic key in the file.
- Use the epic key token exactly as written in docs/54_EPICS.md.

## Required axes (hard)
You MUST output exactly 5 items and they MUST cover these 5 axes exactly once each:
- ordering
- serialization
- id_stability
- rng_streams
- time_sources

No other axis values are allowed in this mode.

## Script usage policy (hard default)
Assume include_scripts_first_class = NO unless the user explicitly states otherwise in this chat.
Interpretation:
- If include_scripts_first_class = NO:
  - Do NOT include any scripts/ or scenes/ paths in any Attachment sketch unless there is no feasible FOUND alternative.
- If include_scripts_first_class = YES:
  - scripts/ or scenes/ paths are allowed when bucketed correctly.

## Diversity preference (soft, apply when possible without violating hard rules)
- Prefer at most ONE item whose Attachment sketch includes SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs.
- If multiple axes naturally reference LogisticsSystem.cs, keep it only for ordering if feasible.

## Candidate item rules (hard)

### Item label (required per item)
- 6 to 12 words
- must NOT contain the standalone word "and" or "including"
- must NOT contain commas, slashes, "plus", or multi-list phrases
- must be single-outcome and closeable in one LLM session
- label should semantically match the Anchor test surface (soft preference, do not violate hard rules)

### Primary deliverable (required per item)
- one of: test, command
- If you believe ui or code is necessary, you must restate it as test or command.

Deliverable specificity rule (hard):
- Must include a concrete target:
  - If test: include `Namespace.Class.Method` test name plus 2 to 4 bullet assertions phrased as invariants.
  - If command: include a single expected output artifact path (FOUND in file map) plus 2 to 4 bullet assertions phrased as invariants about that artifact.

### Buckets (required per item)
Choose either ONE bucket, or TWO buckets joined by a plus sign +.
Buckets must be chosen from this fixed set (no other values):
- SimCore (paths starting with SimCore/)
- Tests (paths starting with SimCore.Tests/)
- ScriptsScenes (paths starting with scripts/ or scenes/)
- DocsTooling (paths starting with docs/ or scripts/tools/)
- DataGenerated (paths starting with scenarios/ or docs/generated/ or SimCore.Tests/TestData/)

Bucket formatting rules (hard):
- If two buckets, format exactly like: Tests+SimCore
- The % character is forbidden in buckets.

### Attachment sketch (required per item)
- 2 to 6 repo-relative paths
- Every path MUST be FOUND in the file map
- Paths must be consistent with the chosen buckets (prefix must match)
- Every item MUST include at least one SimCore.Tests/ path
- If Primary deliverable is command, the item MUST ALSO include at least one scripts/tools/ path
- Avoid doc-only attachment sketches.

Axis-specific attachment constraints (hard):
- rng_streams:
  - If include_scripts_first_class = NO: Attachment sketch MUST NOT include any scripts/ or scenes/ paths.
  - If include_scripts_first_class = YES: Attachment sketch MUST include at least one scripts/ or scenes/ path.

### Anchor path (required per item)
- Must be exactly ONE of the paths listed in Attachment sketch.
- Must be a SimCore.Tests/ path.
- Prefer the primary proof file (the test file).

### Feasibility (required per item)
- 1..5, where 5 is easiest in one LLM session.
- Rubric (hard):
  - 5: add/modify one test file only
  - 4: test plus one SimCore file
  - 3: test plus 2 to 3 files total
  - 2: requires new fixtures/helpers or refactor
  - 1: cross-cutting or multi-surface
- If feasibility <= 2, do not include the item (replace it).

## REQUIRED validation inside the output (hard)
For every candidate item row:
- PathCheck must be exactly FOUND
- AttachCheckAll must be exactly ALL_FOUND

## Hard stop rule for missing axes or missing attach proofs (do not drift)
If you cannot find at least one file-map-confirmed candidate for EACH required axis with ALL emitted paths proven:
- Output sections A, B, C, D anyway.
- In section B, for the failing axis row:
  - Item label MUST start with MISSING: and still be 6 to 12 words total
  - Attachment sketch MUST be 2 to 6 FOUND paths that are the closest available substitutes
  - Anchor path MUST be MISSING
  - PathCheck MUST be MISSING
  - AttachCheckAll MUST be HAS_MISSING
- This is the only allowed deviation from PathCheck=FOUND and AttachCheckAll=ALL_FOUND.

## Output format (mandatory, exactly these sections, in this order)

## A) Epic selection
- EPIC_A: <epic key token>
- Why segmentation is needed: 2 to 5 bullets
- Existing related gates (optional): list up to 6 gate IDs from docs/gates/gates.json that seem adjacent

## B) Candidate segmentation for EPIC_A
Markdown table with columns (exact order):
- Item label (6 to 12 words)
- Axis (enum)
- Primary deliverable (test|command)
- Feasibility (1..5)
- Buckets (one bucket or two joined by +)
- Attachment sketch (2 to 6 existing paths, single line, ; separated)
- Anchor path (SimCore.Tests path from sketch, or MISSING)
- PathCheck (FOUND or MISSING per rules)
- AttachCheckAll (ALL_FOUND or HAS_MISSING per rules)
- Deliverable details (test name or artifact path + invariants)

Row ordering rule (hard):
- Rows MUST appear in this exact axis order:
  1) ordering
  2) serialization
  3) id_stability
  4) rng_streams
  5) time_sources

## C) File-map proof (full proof)
Quote file-map lines copied verbatim from docs/generated/01_CONTEXT_PACKET.md.

Rules:
- You MUST prove EVERY unique path that appears in ANY Attachment sketch, exactly once.
- Proof ordering:
  - First, prove the 5 Anchor paths in row order (B1..B5).
  - Then, prove all remaining non-anchor Attach paths, de-duplicated, in lexicographic order.
- Format:
  - For anchor proofs: prepend exactly `ProofAnchor=Bn:` for each line.
  - For non-anchor proofs: prepend exactly `ProofAttach:` for each line.
- Each quoted proof line must include the full path string.
- If any path cannot be proven, it MUST NOT appear in any Attachment sketch; replace it.

## D) Questions for iteration
- 3 to 6 questions, each <= 14 words, targeted to split/merge decisions.

## Forbidden output
- No JSON.
- No patch plans.
- No “Remaining items” lists.
- No discussion of gates.json schema fields.
- No EPIC_B.
