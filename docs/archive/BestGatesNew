## A) PRECHECK

CANDIDATE_EPICS: S2_5 => [EPIC.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY, EPIC.S2_5.SEEDS, EPIC.S2_5.TOOL.SEED_EXPLORER, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.DISTINCTNESS_GATE, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.ECON.V0, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.FACTION.V0, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.GALAXY.V0, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.INVARIANTS, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.N_SEED_TESTS, EPIC.S2_5.WGEN.WORLD_CLASSES]
CHOSEN_EPIC_A: EPIC.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY

Proof EPIC_A is not “fully implemented in 55” (missing coverage in `docs/55_GATES.md`):

* No Gate IDs exist for Slice 2.5 at all (no `GATE.S2_5.*` entries).
* No DONE gate covers save/load world identity or hash equivalence as a closure proof for worldgen.
* No gate explicitly asserts “save includes seed%worldgen params and load reproduces identical identity” as acceptance criteria.
* No gate defines deterministic ordering requirements for serialization payload stability for world identity.

A2 decision:

* No TODO/IN_PROGRESS gates exist for EPIC_A in `docs/55_GATES.md`, so add NEW rows (6 gates).

existing_gate_id_count: 61

Proposed gate ids (collision=YES/NO):

* GATE.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY.001 collision=NO
* GATE.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY.002 collision=NO
* GATE.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY.003 collision=NO
* GATE.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY.004 collision=NO
* GATE.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY.005 collision=NO
* GATE.S2_5.SAVE_IDENTITY.006 collision=NO
