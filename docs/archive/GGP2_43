# Planning Mode A1.5 v4.3-Compatible (Hardened): Emit FINAL_APPROVED_SEGMENTATION_BLOCK from latest Prompt 1 output + policy

You are in Planning Mode only.

## Inputs source
Use the MOST RECENT occurrences in this chat of:
A) A Prompt 1 segmentation table ("Candidate segmentation") OR an existing "FINAL_APPROVED_SEGMENTATION_BLOCK".
B) The user’s answers to the Prompt 1 questions (already in this chat) OR an explicit DECISION_POLICY block.

Do NOT ask the user to paste anything unless A or B truly cannot be found in the chat transcript.
If A is not found: emit diagnostics + UNABLE_TO_EMIT_BLOCK.
If B is not found: emit diagnostics + UNABLE_TO_EMIT_BLOCK.

## Non-negotiable policy constants (do not infer these)
You MUST enforce axis coverage with EXACTLY these required axes, in this order:
required_axes = ordering, serialization, id_stability, rng_streams, time_sources
target_row_count = 5

Interpretation rule:
- You must select exactly 1 eligible row for each axis in required_axes.
- You may NOT output any duplicate axis.
- If you cannot find an ELIGIBLE candidate row for any axis: fail.

## Additional policy derived from user answers (allowed)
Derive ONLY these flags from user answers (if answers are unclear, use the explicit defaults below):
- include_scripts_first_class: YES|NO (default NO)
- rng_stream_focus: simcore_prefer|simcore_strict|scripts_prefer|scripts_strict|either (default either)
- avoid_logistics_focus: YES|NO (default NO)

rng_stream_focus semantics:
- simcore_strict: rng_streams selected row MUST NOT include any scripts/ path.
- simcore_prefer: prefer a row with more SimCore paths, but scripts allowed if no alternative.
- scripts_strict: rng_streams row MUST include at least one scripts/ path.
- scripts_prefer: prefer scripts if available.
- either: no constraint.

avoid_logistics_focus semantics:
- YES forbids selecting any row whose Attach contains SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs,
  unless there is no eligible candidate for that axis without it.

## Candidate parsing
1) If the most recent artifact is already a FINAL_APPROVED_SEGMENTATION_BLOCK, treat its rows as candidates.
2) Else parse the most recent Prompt 1 table under the heading:
   "## B) Candidate segmentation for EPIC_A"
   Parse ONLY the first Markdown table that appears immediately after that heading.

Normalize attachment sketches into a list:
- split on ;, newlines, and <br>
- trim whitespace
- remove empty entries
- de-duplicate while preserving order

## Eligibility (hard)
A row is ELIGIBLE only if ALL are true:
- Axis is exactly one of required_axes.
- Normalized Attach has 2..6 paths.
- Anchor is present in normalized Attach.
- If the row has a PathCheck field/column, it must be exactly FOUND.
- Anchor must NOT equal MISSING.
- Attach must NOT contain any non-path tokens (e.g. "MISSING").
- Attach must include at least one SimCore.Tests/ path.
- If Primary deliverable is present and equals command: Attach must include at least one scripts/tools/ path.
- If avoid_logistics_focus=YES: exclude rows whose Attach contains SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs,
  unless no eligible alternative exists for that axis.

## Selection algorithm (deterministic)
For each axis in required_axes, choose the best ELIGIBLE candidate row with that axis, subject to policy constraints.

Tie-breaks (apply in order):
1) higher Feasibility (if present; else treat as 0)
2) fewer paths in Attach (after normalization)
3) lexicographic by Anchor path

## Output requirements
ALWAYS print diagnostics first, then either UNABLE_TO_EMIT_BLOCK or the final table.

DIAGNOSTICS must include:
- source_used: candidates_from, policy_from
- parsed_rows, eligible_rows
- eligible_by_axis: counts per axis in required_axes
- derived_policy flags + the constants required_axes and target_row_count
- per-axis selection summary:
  - axis: selected_anchor OR MISSING
- hard check results (computed from the selected rows, not asserted):
  - axes_covered_exactly_once: YES|NO
  - missing_axes: <list>
  - duplicates: <list>
  - target_row_count_satisfied: YES|NO
  - scripts_constraint_satisfied: YES|NO
  - rng_focus_satisfied: YES|NO
  - logistics_avoidance_satisfied: YES|NO
END_DIAGNOSTICS

UNABLE_TO_EMIT_BLOCK condition:
If any hard check is NO, output only UNABLE_TO_EMIT_BLOCK after diagnostics.

If PASS, output:

EPIC_A: EPIC.X.DETERMINISM

## FINAL_APPROVED_SEGMENTATION_BLOCK

| SEG | Label | Axis | Anchor | Attach (2 to 6 paths, ; separated) |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Rules (hard):
- SEG must be 01..05 in required_axes order.
- Label must be copied EXACTLY from the chosen candidate row (no paraphrase).
- Anchor MUST equal the first Attach path.
- You MAY reorder the selected row’s normalized Attach paths so the first path equals Anchor.
  You must not change any path strings; only reorder and trim to 2..6.
- Attach MUST be a single line and include 2..6 normalized paths separated by ; (semicolon+space).
