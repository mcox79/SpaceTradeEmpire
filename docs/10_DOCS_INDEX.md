\# 10\_DOCS\_INDEX



This is the routing index for the documentation kernel. It defines what is canonical (project-level) versus what is generated per session.



If a chat instruction conflicts with canonical repo contracts, update the canonical file first.





\## A. Canonical contracts and architecture (project-level, highest priority)



1\) `docs/00\_READ\_FIRST\_LLM\_CONTRACT.md`

\- The authoritative workflow contract (OUTPUT\_MODE, GIT\_MODE, atomic write rules, constraints).



2\) `docs/10\_ARCHITECTURE\_INDEX.md`

\- The router into architecture excerpts.

\- Do not attach the full architecture by default; use this index to select the minimum excerpt.



3\) `docs/ArchitectureV7.4.txt`

\- The canonical architecture body (referenced by excerpt via `docs/10\_ARCHITECTURE\_INDEX.md`).



4\) `docs/20\_TESTING\_AND\_DETERMINISM.md`

\- Testing strategy, determinism expectations, and what is considered a valid test signal.



5\) `docs/30\_CONNECTIVITY\_AND\_INTERFACES.md`

\- Layering rules and connectivity scan contract (including determinism requirements).





\## B. Operational workflow (project-level, changes occasionally)



6\) `docs/40\_TOOLING\_AND\_HOOKS.md`

\- Canonical command lines for tools and validations.

\- What to attach per session vs what stays project-level.

\- Hook behavior and installation expectations.



7\) `docs/90\_GLOSSARY\_AND\_IDS.md`

\- Canonical vocabulary and identifiers referenced across docs and code.



8\) `docs/README.md`

\- The docs entrypoint and high-level orientation for humans.





\## C. Templates (project-level)



9\) `docs/templates/01\_CONTEXT\_PACKET.template.md`

\- The template used by the generator.

\- Do not attach this in sessions.





\## D. Generated per session (always changes)



All generated artifacts live under:

\- `docs/generated/`



10\) `docs/generated/01\_CONTEXT\_PACKET.md`

\- The default session attachment.

\- Contains: objective, modes, allowlist, validations, definition of done.



11\) `docs/generated/connectivity\_manifest.json`

12\) `docs/generated/connectivity\_graph.json`

13\) `docs/generated/connectivity\_violations.json`

\- Generated by the connectivity scanner.

\- Attach `connectivity\_violations.json` only when it is non-empty or needed for diagnosis.

\- Do not paste full JSON outputs into chat by default; reference by path and include only targeted excerpts when necessary.





\## E. Planned outputs (not implemented unless explicitly created)



These names may be used later, but must not be referenced as if they exist until implemented:

\- `docs/generated/02\_CONNECTIVITY\_MAP.md`

\- `docs/generated/03\_TEST\_RUN\_REPORT.md`
