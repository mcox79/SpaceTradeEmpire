| GATE.PROG.UI.001 | DONE | Program vs ManualOverride interaction is defined and deterministic: issuing ManualOverride cancels any active LogisticsJob for that fleet and emits a schema-bound ManualOverrideSet event; ProgramSystem deterministically consumes ManualOverrideSet and pauses fleet-bound programs before intent emission; interaction is contract-tested | SimCore/Programs/ProgramSystem.cs; SimCore/Programs/ProgramBook.cs; scripts/ui/ProgramsMenu.cs; SimCore.Tests/Programs/ProgramContractTests.cs; SimCore.Tests/Programs/ProgramLifecycleContractTests.cs; SimCore/Commands/FleetSetDestinationCommand.cs; SimCore/Events/LogisticsEvents.cs; SimCore/Programs/ProgramInstance.cs |
| GATE.UI.FLEET.PLAY.001 | DONE | First playable fleet capstone is accessible and verifiable in-game: boot playable_prototype scene, dock at station, StationMenu exposes Fleets entrypoint, Fleet panel renders and supports deterministic fleet selection, CancelJob, Override, ClearOverride; ActiveController and override target are surfaced; selected fleet shows deterministic newest-first event tail with stable serialization; Save/Load mid-sequence preserves visible fleet state and event tail after refresh; headless smoke emits deterministic transcript with stable hash including Seed, tick, per-fleet state (fleet_id, command source tag, ActiveController, job fields, override target) and ordered event tail. Non-goal: no galaxy scale tuning, no procgen variety validation, no aesthetics checks, no other gameplay loops | scenes/playable_prototype.tscn + scripts/ui/StationMenu.cs + scripts/ui/FleetMenu.cs + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + SimCore/Entities/Fleet.cs + SimCore/Commands/FleetJobCancelCommand.cs + SimCore/Commands/FleetSetDestinationCommand.cs |


### B9. Slice 3 programs and logistics explainability gates (v1)
| Gate ID | Status | Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| GATE.UI.PROGRAMS.001 | DONE | Programs screen minimal readout via SimBridge facts only; deterministic ordering enforced (ordinal) for program list and detail fields; headless UI smoke clean; gate validation passes | scripts/ui/ProgramsMenu.cs + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + SimCore/Programs/ProgramSystem.cs + SimCore/Programs/ProgramInstance.cs |
| GATE.UI.PROGRAMS.EVENT.001 | DONE | Programs screen shows last N program events with deterministic ordering (Seq-desc, stable ties), stable serialization through save%load (quicksave v2 wraps kernel JSON + program event log), and clickable entity references (id links copy to clipboard). Note: no causal attribution yet from program events to logistics%movement event stream. | scripts/ui/ProgramsMenu.cs + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + SimCore/Programs/ProgramExplain.cs + SimCore/Programs/ProgramSystem.cs |
| GATE.UI.LOGISTICS.001 | DONE | Logistics screen minimal readout via SimBridge facts: active jobs touching current market plus bottlenecks summary from buffer deficits; nonblocking snapshot (cached when sim lock busy); deterministic ordering for displayed lists (jobs by fleet_id ordinal; bottlenecks by deficit desc, then good_id ordinal, then site_id ordinal) | scripts/ui/StationMenu.cs + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs + SimCore/Entities/LogisticsJob.cs |
| GATE.UI.LOGISTICS.EVENT.001 | DONE | Station logistics panel renders deterministic incident timeline (newest first) sourced from schema-bound LogisticsEventLog; zero-pickup cancel incident expands into traversable cause chain of preceding pickup observations; stable snapshot serialization and ordering (Seq desc with tie-breakers) | scripts/ui/StationMenu.cs + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + SimCore/Events/LogisticsEvents.cs + SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs |
| GATE.UI.EXPLAIN.PLAY.001 | DONE | Explainability capstone: guided headless path deterministically triggers one representative failure (credits constraint) and surfaces the full “why” chain; output is captured to docs/generated/phase3_explain_capstone_stdout.txt with stable hash64= for repro; save/load preserves explanation transcript hash (no post-load tick advance); end to end headless proof exits 0 | scripts/tests/phase3_explain_capstone.gd + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + scripts/ui/StationMenu.cs + scripts/ui/ProgramsMenu.cs + SimCore/World/WorldLoader.cs + SimCore/Events/LogisticsEvents.cs + docs/generated/phase3_explain_capstone_stdout.txt |
| GATE.UI.DOCK.NONSTATION.001 | DONE | Non-station docking UI market resolution: docking at any StarNode (ex: star_16) deterministically opens StationMenu without F9; PlayerShip emits shop_toggled(true, dock_id) for both stations and non-stations by resolving id via get_sim_market_id() else sim_market_id meta else node.name; StationMenu remains usable (Undock, Fleets, Save/Load, Explain) while market panel degrades explicitly N/A when dock_id has no market mapping; no ERROR spam from market resolution on non-market nodes | scripts/player.gd + scripts/view/GalaxyView.cs + scripts/view/StarNode.cs + scripts/ui/StationMenu.cs + scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs + scenes/playable_prototype.tscn |

### B10. Slice 3 scaling and economy gates (v0)

| Gate ID | Status | Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| GATE.S3.ROUTES.001 | DONE | Multi-route primitives v0: RoutePlanner now generates multiple route candidates (>=2) in a crafted map using deterministic DFS over edge-id sorted adjacency; deterministic ordering and selection tie-break is enforced as: fewer hops, then lower risk proxy score, then lex route_id; LogisticsSystem emits schema-bound RouteChosen explain event with fields {OriginId, DestId, ChosenRouteId, CandidateCount, TieBreakReason} (emitted only when CandidateCount>=2 to reduce spam); regression tests cover (1) multi-route candidate ordering by hops%risk%route_id and (2) equal-hop stable choice with TieBreakReason=ROUTE_ID plus schema validation for RouteChosen event | Proof: dotnet test "SimCore.Tests/SimCore.Tests.csproj" -c Release PASS (106 passed); deterministic longrun hashes unchanged in output; warnings eliminated |
| GATE.S3.FLEET.ROLES.001 | DONE | Fleet roles v0: introduce explicit roles (Trader, Hauler, Patrol) that deterministically affect exactly one decision surface (route-choice selection): Trader prefers profit score, Hauler prefers capacity score, Patrol prefers low-risk score; emit schema-bound FleetEvents.RouteChoice for each resolved competing choice; persist chosen route id on Fleet (LastRouteChoiceRouteId) through save%load; ordering%serialization stable | SimCore/Entities/Fleet.cs + SimCore/Systems/IntentSystem.cs + SimCore/SimState.cs + SimCore/Events/FleetEvents.cs + SimCore.Tests/Systems/FleetAuthorityPrecedenceContractTests.cs |
| GATE.S3.CAPACITY_SCARCITY.001 | DONE | Lane capacity scarcity v0 (queueing model): each lane has capacity K per tick enforced at delivery; if >K transfers arrive on same lane same tick, deliver in deterministic order (ArriveTick, LaneId, TransferId) up to K and deterministically queue overflow by bumping ArriveTick=Tick+1; lane utilization report v0 emitted deterministically sorted by lane_id; regression scenario covered: capacity K=5 overload produces partial fill and queued remainder with stable per-transfer remainders across ticks | SimCore/Systems/LaneFlowSystem.cs;SimCore.Tests/Systems/LaneFlowSystemTests.cs;SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs;SimCore/Gen/GalaxyGenerator.cs;SimCore.Tests/Determinism/LongRunWorldHashTests.cs;SimCore.Tests/GoldenReplayTests.cs |
| GATE.S3.MARKET_ARB.001 | DONE | Anti-exploit market arb constraint v0: explicit “money printer” scenario constrained; unbounded profit prevented via exactly two frictions (v0): transaction_fee (TransactionFeeBps=100 with nonzero fee sink) and lane_capacity scarcity (queueing observed); acceptance: T=600 vs T=300 bounded_check PASS; reason codes emitted (lane_cap_queued_ticks and fee_total_credits%no-fee proxy); outputs deterministic | SimCore.Tests/MarketTests.cs + SimCore/Systems/MarketSystem.cs + SimCore/Systems/LaneFlowSystem.cs + SimCore/Systems/LogisticsSystem.cs + SimCore.Tests/Determinism/LongRunWorldHashTests.cs + docs/generated/market_arb_constraint_report.txt |
| GATE.S3.UI.DASH.001 | DONE | Dashboards v0: StationMenu exposes deterministic metrics from the last snapshot tick via SimBridge snapshot: total_shipments, avg_delay_ticks, top3_bottleneck_lanes, top3_profit_loops; ordering stable (ties broken lex); save%load persists selected Station view index and last dashboard snapshot tick in STE_QUICKSAVE_V2; deterministic serialization preserved | Validate-Gates OK; dotnet test SimCore.Tests PASS (net8.0). Notes: top3_bottleneck_lanes is v0 derived from logistics event note parsing; top3_profit_loops is a price-diff proxy loop metric (v0 scaffolding). Evidence: scripts/bridge/SimBridge.cs;scripts/ui/StationMenu.cs;SimCore/Systems/SerializationSystem.cs;SimCore/Systems/SustainmentReport.cs |
| GATE.S3.PERF_BUDGET.001 | DONE | Perf budget v0 for Slice 3: fixed scenario (seed=424242, deterministic map) runs 600 ticks; measures average tick time over last 300 ticks via Stopwatch around Step(); enforces budget_ms_per_tick constant and emits PERF_BUDGET_REPORT_V0 (invariant formatting); includes deterministic guard test that fails when budget exceeded; scenario load check fleets>=50 and active_transfers>=200 satisfied via deterministic synthetic seeding of SimState.InFlightTransfers (v0 stopgap, replace with end-to-end Logistics scheduling in v1) | SimCore.Tests/Determinism/LongRunWorldHashTests.cs;SimCore.Tests/GoldenReplayTests.cs;SimCore/SimKernel.cs;SimCore/Systems/BandedTime.cs |
| GATE.S3.SAVELOAD.SCALING.001 | TODO | Scaling save%load contract v0 (momentum-safe): save%load is crash-free and preserves lane capacity queues, chosen routes, and market fee state; replaying from save yields identical event stream and final world hash under the same command script | TBD |
| GATE.UI.PLAY.TRADELOOP.001 | TODO | First playable trade loop v0: start new game from Seed, spawn 1 player fleet at starter hub, execute 1 loop end-to-end (buy, ship, sell) using logistics; observe profit delta; headless play script emits deterministic transcript; no timestamps; byte-for-byte stable | TBD |
| GATE.UI.PLAY.TRADELOOP.SAVELOAD.001 | TODO | Play loop save%load v0: during an active trade loop, save%load preserves visible state (selected fleet, active job, cargo, cash) and after continuing to completion yields identical final world hash and identical per-fleet event stream across runs | TBD |
